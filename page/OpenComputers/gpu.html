            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is the component provided by graphics cards.</p>
            <p>Component name: <code> gpu</code>.</p>

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>bind(address: string[, reset: boolean=true]): boolean[, string] </code> Tries to bind the GPU to a screen with the specified address. Returns true on success, false and an error message on failure. Resets the screen's settings if reset is 'true'. A GPU can only be bound to one screen at a time. All operations on it will work on the bound screen. If you wish to control multiple screens at once, you'll need to put more than one graphics card into your computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getScreen():string</code> Get the address of the screen the GPU is bound to. Since 1.3.2.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getBackground(): number, boolean</code> Gets the current background color. This background color is applied to all “pixels” that get changed by other operations.<br />
                    Note that the returned number is either an RGB value in hexadecimal format, i.e. 0xRRGGBB, or a palette index. The second returned value indicates which of the two it is (true for palette color, false for RGB value).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setBackground(color: number[, isPaletteIndex: boolean]): number[, index]</code> Sets the background color to apply to “pixels” modified by other operations from now on. <br />
                    The returned value is the old background color, as the actual value it was set to (i.e. not compressed to the color space currently set). The first value is the previous color as an RGB value. <br />
                    If the color was from the palette, the second value will be the index in the palette.<br />
                    Otherwise it will be nil. Note that the color is expected to be specified in hexadecimal RGB format, i.e. 0xRRGGBB. <br />
                    This is to allow uniform color operations regardless of the color depth supported by the screen and GPU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getForeground(): number, boolean</code> Like getBackground, but for the foreground color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setForeground(color: number[, isPaletteIndex: boolean]): number[, index]</code> Like setBackground, but for the foreground color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getPaletteColor(index: number): number</code> Gets the RGB value of the color in the palette at the specified index.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setPaletteColor(index: number, value: number): number</code> Sets the RGB value of the color in the palette at the specified index.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>maxDepth(): number</code> Gets the maximum supported color depth supported by the GPU and the screen it is bound to (minimum of the two).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getDepth(): number</code> The currently set color depth of the GPU/screen, in bits. Can be 1, 4 or 8.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setDepth(bit: number): string</code> Sets the color depth to use. <br />
                    Can be up to the maximum supported color depth.<br />
                    If a larger or invalid value is provided it will throw an error. <br />
                    Returns the old depth as one of the strings OneBit, FourBit, or EightBit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>maxResolution(): number, number</code> Gets the maximum resolution supported by the GPU and the screen it is bound to (minimum of the two).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getResolution(): number, number</code> Gets the currently set resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setResolution(width: number, height: number): boolean</code> Sets the specified resolution.<br />
                    Can be up to the maximum supported resolution. <br />
                    If a larger or invalid resolution is provided it will throw an error. <br />
                    Returns true if the resolution was changed (may return false if an attempt was made to set it to the same value it was set before), false otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getViewport(): number, number</code> Get the current viewport resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setViewport(width: number, height: number): boolean</code> Set the current viewport resolution. <br />
                    Returns true if it was changed (may return false if an attempt was made to set it to the same value it was set before), false otherwise. <br />
                    This makes it look like screen resolution is lower, but the actual resolution stays the same. <br />
                    Characters outside top-left corner of specified size are just hidden, and are intended for rendering or storing things off-screen and copying them to the visible area when needed. <br />
                    Changing resolution will change viewport to whole screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getSize(): number, number</code> Gets the size in blocks of the screen the graphics card is bound to. <br />
                    For simple screens and robots this will be one by one.<br />
                    Deprecated, use screen.getAspectRatio() instead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>get(x: number, y: number): string, number, number, number or nil, number or nil</code> Gets the character currently being displayed at the specified coordinates.<br />
                    The second and third returned values are the fore- and background color, as hexvalues.<br />
                    If the colors are from the palette, the fourth and fifth values specify the palette index of the color, otherwise they are nil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>set(x: number, y: number, value: string[, vertical:boolean]): boolean</code> Writes a string to the screen, starting at the specified coordinates. <br />
                    The string will be copied to the screen's buffer directly, in a single row. <br />
                    This means even if the specified string contains line breaks, these will just be printed as special characters, the string will not be displayed over multiple lines. <br />
                    Returns true if the string was set to the buffer, false otherwise.<br />
                    The optional fourth argument makes the specified text get printed vertically instead, if true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>copy(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number, tx: number, ty: number): boolean</code> Copies a portion of the screens buffer to another location. <br />
                    The source rectangle is specified by the x, y, width and height parameters. <br />
                    The target rectangle is defined by x + tx, y + ty, width and height.<br />
                    Returns true on success, false otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>fill(x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number, char: string): boolean</code> Fills a rectangle in the screen buffer with the specified character.<br />
                    The target rectangle is specified by the x and y coordinates and the rectangle's width and height. <br />
                    The fill character char must be a string of length one, i.e. a single character.<br />
                    Returns true on success, false otherwise.<br />
                    Note that filling screens with spaces ( ) is usually less expensive, i.e. consumes less energy, because it is considered a “clear” operation (see config).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getActiveBuffer(): number</code> Returns the index of the currently selected buffer. <br />
                    0 is reserved for the screen, and may return 0 even when there is no screen
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>setActiveBuffer(index: number): number</code> Sets the active buffer to index.<br />
                    0 is reserved for the screen and can be set even when there is no screen.<br />
                    Returns nil for an invalid index (0 is valid even with no screen)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>buffers(): table</code> Returns an array of all current page indexes (0 is not included in this list, that is reserved for the screen).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>allocateBuffer([width: number, height: number]): number</code> Allocates a new buffer with dimensions width*heigh (gpu max resolution by default). <br />
                    Returns the index of this new buffer or error when there is not enough video memory. <br />
                    A buffer can be allocated even when there is no screen bound to this gpu.<br />
                    Index 0 is always reserved for the screen and thus the lowest possible index of an allocated buffer is always 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>freeBuffer([index: number]): boolean</code> Removes buffer at index (default: current buffer index).<br />
                    Returns true if the buffer was removed.<br />
                    When you remove the currently selected buffer, the gpu automatically switches back to index 0 (reserved for a screen).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>freeAllBuffers()</code> Removes all buffers, freeing all video memory. <br />
                    The buffer index is always 0 after this call.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>totalMemory(): number</code> Returns the total memory size of the gpu vram. <br />
                    This does not include the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>freeMemory(): number</code> Returns the total free memory not allocated to buffers. <br />
                    This does not include the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>getBufferSize([index: number]): number, number</code> Returns the buffer size at index (default: current buffer index). <br />
                    Returns the screen resolution for index 0. <br />
                    Returns nil for invalid indexes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>bitblt([dst: number, col: number, row: number, width: number, height: number, src: number, fromCol: number, fromRow: number])</code> Copy a region from buffer to buffer, screen to buffer, or buffer to screen. Defaults:<br />
                    dst = 0, the screen<br />
                    col, row = 1,1<br />
                    width, height = resolution of the destination buffer<br />
                    src = the current buffer<br />
                    fromCol, fromRow = 1,1 bitblt should preform very fast on repeated use.<br />
                    If the buffer is dirty there is an initial higher cost to sync the buffer with the destination object.<br />
                    If you have a large number of updates to make with frequent bitblts, consider making multiple and smaller buffers.<br />
                    If you plan to use a static buffer (one with few or no updatse), then a large buffer is just fine. <br />
                    Returns true on success
